# Survival Analysis
To generate the results for survival analysis, download perform_survival_analysis.R, liver_dat_cleaned.csv, and immuno_dat_cleaned.csv into the same folder. Change the working directory provided in setwd() to your current working directory (where you stored the files). Source the R file to generate the patient survival curves and graft survival curves for the 3 age groups (18 - 49, 50 - 64, and 65+) as well as a pvalue.txt file containing the p-values from the log-rank test in LaTeX format.
